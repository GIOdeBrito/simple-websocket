# Simple WebSocket Js

This is a most setup as to how does a WebSocket connection between
a server and a client work.<br>
This idea came to me as I remembered a
Computer Network project of eld times.


## Requirements
- A machine running a Linux system (optional)
- Ws - WebSocket
- Node.js


## Build and Run 

First of all, it is necessary to install the <b>WebSocket</b> library.<br>
Open the terminal and install <b>ws</b>.

```bash
    npm install ws
```

Pretty effortless, hm? As the terminal takes care of mostly everything for us.<br>
After that, open the <b>ws-server.js</b> file with node, the file is located at the project's root folder.

```bash
    node ws-server.js
```

Node shall notify you whether the application is presently running on port 8080. After that, one can simply open the <b>index.html</b> on the preffered browser, normally.
